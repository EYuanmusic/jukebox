[Verse 1]
Under the galaxy, we shine so bright
Magical vibes, taking flight
Emotions soaring, we feel alive
Like shooting stars, we thrive

[Chorus]
Under the galaxy, where all the cosmos thrive, through the dark
We feel the magic, it's all around
Our feet on the ground, but our souls unbound

[Verse 2]
Under the galaxy, we're one with the stars
Our dreams and wishes, reaching far
Emotions like comets, blazing by
We're living life, we're not afraid to fly

[Chorus]
Under the galaxy, where all the cosmos thrive, through the dark
We feel the magic, it's all around
Our feet on the ground, but our souls unbound

[Bridge]
In the silence of the night, we hear the universe call
Drawing us in, like a cosmic thrall
In the symphony of the stars, a celestial choir
Guiding our hearts, lifting us higher and higher

[Verse 3]
Under the galaxy, the constellations tell our story
Each one a chapter, leading to glory
We're writing our fates in the cosmic ink
Dancing through space, what do you think?

[Outro]
Under the galaxy, we dance and we dream
In the vast expanse, nothing's as it seems
But we'll keep reaching for the stars, forever it seems
Under the galaxy, we'll make all our dreams come true
